# Kununu Analysis: Measuring company culture and employee satisfaction



## Project Description: 

### Company Chosen: Bechtle AG 
- Bechtle AG is a German IT company that provides IT systems and solutions for businesses and organizations. It is headquartered in Neckarsulm, Germany, and operates through a network of more than 70 branches throughout Europe. The company offers a wide range of products and services, including IT infrastructure, software, and consulting. Bechtle also provides IT services such as cloud computing, managed services, and IT security. The company is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

- In this project, I utilize Kununu data to measure Bechtle's employee satisfaction rate via Kununa reviews left by former employees. 

- I perform a benchmarking analysis with competitors in Bechtle's industry


## Insights: 

- Bechtle provides multiple entry level opportunities, but low chance of long-term career development.
- Bechtle performed lower than SAP & the Industry benchmark in regard to employee compensation, management behaviour, communication and transparency.
- Since 2013, Bechtle’s overall review score has been lower than the industry average.  
- Topic Modelling: Identified 3 key topics predominantly mentioned by former employees: "Career Opportunities", "Remuneration", and "Team Dynamic“ when analyzing the two most answered categories of Kununu 'Gut am Arbeitgeber' & 'Schlecht am Arbeitgeber‘. 
- Contrary to SAP’s remuneration statistics, Bechtle’s remuneration and pay are consistently seen as an issue. About 51% of the information captured within this topic conveys a negative theme.
