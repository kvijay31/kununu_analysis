# Kununu Analysis: Measuring company culture and employee satisfaction



## Project Description: 

### Company Chosen: Bechtle AG 
- Bechtle AG is a German IT company that provides IT systems and solutions for businesses and organizations. It is headquartered in Neckarsulm, Germany, and operates through a network of more than 70 branches throughout Europe. The company offers a wide range of products and services, including IT infrastructure, software, and consulting. Bechtle also provides IT services such as cloud computing, managed services, and IT security. The company is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

- In this project, I utilize Kununu data to measure Bechtle's employee satisfaction rate via Kununa reviews left by former employees. 

- I perform a benchmarking analysis with competitors in Bechtle's industry


## Insights: 

- Bechtle provides multiple entry level opportunities, but low chance of long-term career development.
